# K-Nearest Neighbors for Digit Classification
This project explores the use of KNN algorithm to classify a database of handwritten digits. The algorithm does not use scikit-learn's built in KNNClassifier but instead a custom version that I have built.

## Getting Started ##
* This classifier uses helper functions like getCounts, majority, classify instead of the actual classifier. 
* While the program does use scikit-learn for some parts, the main classifier is fully custom-built.

### Prerequisites ###
* GitBash or any other shell
* Python 
* Libraries including scikit-learn 

To give you an example, I used GitBash for my shell and Python installed as well as Anaconda distribution (because it comes with most libraries or can be installed easily).

### Installing and running the code ###
* To run the program, open **KNN_Classifier.ipynb**. This being a Jupyter notebook file, you can easily run the program on your local machine.
* Clone the repo to your local machine.
* Use GitBash or any other shell and navigate to the directory.
* Once in the directory, type `jupyter notebook` and you will be navigated to a browser window with the code.
* Once you see the code, feel free to implement the code, edit or anything else you might want to do.
